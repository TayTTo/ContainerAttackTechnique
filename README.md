# Attack methods to system using container.
#### Attacks abusing insecure container images.
- Attackers can abuse vulnerable or outdated software components to do malicious activities on the system.
#### Abusing privileged container.
- Attackers can gain control over the underlying host system through running container with root-level access.

#### Abusing environment misconfiguration.
- Attacker can abuse an application to access resources outside it's container if that container's access controls are misconfigured.

#### Supply chain vulnerabilities.
- Application often use third-party dependencies, container can create vulnerable or contain malicious code.

#### Container escape techniques.
1. Mount the host filesystem.
- Escape from container by mounting the host filesystem.
- Minimal required Linux capabilities: SYS_ADMIN.

2. Use a mounted docker socket.
- If the docker socket is mounted inside container, the container can gain administrative control over the Docker host.
- Minimal Linux required Linux capabilities: no.

3. Process injection.
- This is the technique that use a process to write into the memory of another process to execute a shellcode .
- Minimal required Linux capabilities: SYS_PTRACE.

4. Shared kernel exploitation.
- A container cal load and unload kernel modules into the shared kernel.
- Minimal required Linux capabilities: SYS_MODULE.

5. Dump host secrets.
- This technique refers to unauthorized extraction of sensitive information stored within cluster.

#### Container image tampering.
- Modifying or replacing container images with malicious versions that may contain malware, backdoors, or vulneralbe components.
#### Privilege escalation through node/proxy permissions

#### Denial of services(Dos)
- Consume resource of container to disrupt the ability of containerized applications

#### Create client certificate credential.
- Attacker can steal those credential to authenticate and access to the cluster with credential assigned privileges.

#### Create long-lived token.
- By someway, the attacker can gain such token and have an unexpected long period of time to access to the system.

#### Abusing kernel vulnerabilities.
- Attackers can abuse kernel vulnerabilities in the system's operating system to gain higher access right to the system. For example: Abuse kernel vulnerabilities to gain root access to the system.

#### Abusing volume hostPath mount.
- Attackers can escape pod's containerized environment and have higher access right to the systeme by creating a pod that mount the entire node's root filesystem using the hostPath volume.

2. CVE-2021-41091.
- CVSS 3.1: 6.3
- Attack complexity: Low 
- Confidentially: Low
- Integrity: Low
- Availability: Low
- Scope: changed
- Privileges required: Low
- Published: Sep 15, 2021. (Source: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41091)
- CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.
- CWE-281: ImproperÂ Preservation of Permissions.

- Summary:
    - Related to Moby (an open-source project).
    - Data directory contains subdirectories with low restriction in permissions, allow unprivileged user to traverse directory.
    - The bug have been fixed in version 20.10.9 in Moby.

3. CVE-2024-6222
- CVSS 4.0: 7.3
- Attack complexity: High
- Confidentially: High
- Integrity: High
- Availability: High
- Scope: Unchanged
- Privileges required: Low
- Published: Jul 10, 2024
- CWE-923: Improper restriction of Communication Chanel to Intended Endpoints.

- Summary:
    - Relates to Docker Desktop before v4.29.0.
    - Attackers who can access to Docker Desktop VM through container breakout can further escape to the host.
    - At version 4.29.0, this problem is fixed and then in v4.31.0 enable "Allow only extensions distributed through the Docker Marketplace" by default to avoid this kind of exploitation.
